HERE WE COOK AGAIN
Everybody, who doesn't rely on frozen pizza, pasta with ketchup and chicken nuggets anymore, knows the game. What am I gonna cook today?

How to fight my way through the online cookbook jungle? Seems like the internet is helping but at the same time not. Tons of influencers showing delicious looking videos, linking to their website, which are full of advertisements and paragraphs starting like "When my great great great grandmother in 1898...". And then also remembering all these sources, having a massive amount bookmarks or even an excel. 

What is the solution? My very own website with a collection of recipes that I and my boyfriend like. 
Easy to read.
Different filters, that matter to us.
An easy form to add new recipes. 

I'm still working on this, there are a lot of features, that will make this website a perfect cooking companion. My boyfriend is American, I'm German. So what is up with cups??? And why are there not only American, but also British cups. We defintely need a converter for measuring. 

So here's the list of my current to-do:
- make delete & edit button work
- english/german
- unit converter
- add source of the recipe
- filter by stuff that is in our fridge

Stay tuned!
